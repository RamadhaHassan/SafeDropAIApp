SafeDropAiApp

AI rider and shop safety tool for online deliveries

Project Overview

SafeDropAiApp helps shop owners and riders confirm buyers before sending goods. The tool checks identity, phone details, location, and risk signs. It supports riders with alerts and a simple safety flow. The goal is to reduce attacks on riders and losses for shops.

Main Features

Buyer check flow with selfie, phone check, and location

Face match check for identity

Liveness check to prevent fake photos

Risk score from 0 to 100

Rider safety steps with arrival timer and quick alert

Shop dashboard for orders and checks

Data trail for follow-up if crime happens

How the System Works

The shop sends a buyer link through the dashboard

The buyer completes the check

The system reviews the information and gives a score

The shop sees the score and decides if the rider should go

The rider follows safety steps and uses the alert if needed
